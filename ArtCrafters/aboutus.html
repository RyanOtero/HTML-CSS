                <h2>Our Love for Craftsmanship</h2>
                <p>
                    Long before the vision of ArtCrafters, Greg was a humble tradesman working in the new construction industry as a 
                    tile installer. He took his son to work with him often and taught him the trade as well.Over the years, Greg picked up other trades and developed a love for woodworking. Meanwhile, his son grew up and became a welder/fabricator. After ten years of mastering fabrication as his father had mastered many other trades, an idea began to creep into the son's mind.

                <h2>ArtCrafters Comes Alive</h2>
                <p>
                    Greg's son always had a love for the creation process, ever since he was a small boy helping his father on the weekends.
                    He dabbled in arts/crafting whenever he had the time, from sculpting in clay and leatherworking, to 3d modeling and graphic design. But dabbling was no longer enough for him. It was time to bring all of the expertise of the two men together to create something more profound than either had created on their own. Something that would incorporate the dedication and focus of the father and the creativity and curiosity of the son. And so the first project began...
